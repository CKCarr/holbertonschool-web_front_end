# Accessibility
## Learning Objectives

### ARIAâ€™s main purpose:

ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. Its main purpose is to enhance the accessibility of web content and web applications for individuals with disabilities. ARIA provides additional information to assistive technologies (like screen readers) in understanding and interacting with web elements that may not be inherently accessible using standard HTML. It adds roles, states, and properties to HTML elements to convey their purpose and behavior more clearly to assistive technologies.

### WCAG conformance levels (A, AA, and AAA):

WCAG stands for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These guidelines are a set of internationally recognized standards for making web content accessible to people with disabilities. There are three conformance levels:

- Level A (Single A): This is the minimum level of accessibility compliance. It includes the most basic requirements to ensure some level of accessibility.

- Level AA (Double A): This is the most commonly targeted conformance level. It includes Level A requirements and additional criteria, making web content more accessible to a wider range of individuals with disabilities.

- Level AAA (Triple A): This is the highest level of accessibility compliance and includes all Level A and AA requirements. It aims to provide the highest level of accessibility, but it can be challenging to achieve and may not be practical for all websites.

### The importance of Web Accessibility:

Web accessibility is crucial because it ensures that all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can access and interact with web content. It promotes inclusivity and equal access to information and services on the internet.

Failing to make websites accessible can exclude a significant portion of the population, which is not only ethically wrong but can also have legal consequences.

It's essential for businesses, organizations, and developers to prioritize web accessibility to reach a broader audience and meet legal requirements.

### Tools to use for Web Accessibility:

There are several tools available to help developers and designers ensure web accessibility:

- Screen Readers: These are software programs that read aloud the content of a web page to individuals with visual impairments. Examples include JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver.

- Accessibility Validators: Tools like WAVE, axe, and the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE) can help identify accessibility issues on web pages.

- Color Contrast Checkers: Tools like Contrast Checker help ensure text and background colors meet contrast requirements for readability.

- Keyboard Testing: Testing with a keyboard only (without a mouse) ensures that all interactive elements are navigable and usable through keyboard commands.

- Browser Developer Tools: Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that include accessibility audit features to help identify and fix accessibility issues.

- User Testing: Real-world testing with individuals who have disabilities can provide valuable feedback on a website's accessibility.
